STATELESS ARCHITECTURE:

To expand the web tier we need to separate the session data from the web servers to persistent storage, like NO SQL, Relational Databases, Redis DB(confirm about this). So that when a user send a request there is no need to send to route that request to a particular web-server where the users session data is stored, any web server can pick that request and get the session data from persistent storage.

This will help to horizontally expand the servers and allow to do more business globally.


NO-SQL is used as it has the capability to expand more easily.
